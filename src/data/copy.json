You wake up early to watch TV. You stumble out of bed, down the stairs, and you hear Grandma.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandma is always awake before you. She putters around in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut today, you notice she's squatted in the kitchen – and that means it's that day again.\r\n\r\n\r\nKimchi day.","scene2":"\r\n\r\nIt's bright, salty, and briney – with a sweet vegetal flavor undercutting it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not fermented yet. But you like it best before it's had time to get funky.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you chew, new flavors emerge. A spicy, garlicky note dances atop your tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou take another bite. The leafy parts of the cabbage carry so much flavor, almost too much. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut the white parts, which have yet to take in the marinade, give your palette some relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a pleasing cycle – bright, salt, sweet, spicy, funk, and then relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou wonder how many generations of your family have eaten this exact kimchi.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou'll never forget this flavor.","scene3":"It's fall of 2005 – your first year of college in New York City. \r\n\r\n\r\nToday, you can't stop thinking about her kimchi.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're thousands of miles from your home in Kansas. And Grandma now lives in Seoul.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou try to remember how she made her kimchi.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of desperation, you try to make it for yourself.","scene4":"Something is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich means everything is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt tastes exactly like the sum of its ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou always felt that Grandma did something to transform these ingredients. People always say you can taste the \"love\" in homemade food, but what does that even mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's salty. A little too garlicky. Not spicy enough. Not funky enough. Not refreshing enough. This isn't it.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou mentioned to some Korean students that you missed kimchi, and they kind of laughed at you. \r\n\r\n\r\nThey said you should go clubbing with them next weekend, and they'll take you to eat Korean food afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt doesn't sound like your kind of scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou miss your family.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou miss home.","scene5":"It's the fall of 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter several years living in majority-white neighborhoods in New England, this is your first week back in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a period of change in your life, and right now there is no place that feels like home.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York  feels like a place that used to be home. But much has changed since you left.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor one, there are Korean restaurants everywhere. Kimchi this, kimchi that. You even hear white people in Midtown talking about how much they love making kimchi.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou walk around your new neighborhood in Brooklyn, and you hear a Korean man muttering to himself. You can't understand it; you forgot most of your Korean. But it turns out he's the owner of a new Korean restaurant, and he's telling you to try his food.\r\n\r\n\r\nSure, you say.","scene6":"It's OK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean, it's good. It really is. Salty, sour, funky, slightly sweet. I mean, it's kimchi.\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, to be honest, it tastes like Americanized kimchi. It's not too funky, not too spicy, not too salty. It's fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou sit alone in the restaurant, eating kimchi and galbitang, which is beef rib soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know that feeling when you so desperately need to feel the comforts of home, but instead you encounter a reminder of home?\r\n\r\n\r\nA flavor?\r\n\r\n\r\nA smell?\r\n\r\n\r\nA color?\r\n\r\n\r\nA shape?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis kimchi reminds you of all the things that make you feel comfortable.","scene7":"It's the fall of 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many people sharing their kimchi recipes. So initially you followed those recipes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was OK. But you remember a few things Grandma liked to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe brined her napa cabbage in salt water for a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe chopped up her garlic and scallions finely. \r\n\r\n\r\nThen she mixed it with gochugaru, sugar, fermented baby shrimp, and this cooked sweet rice paste.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe took that mixture and slathered it between every single napa leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you take those recipes, and you tweak them to mimic what Grandma did.","scene8":"It's fresh, salty, and slightly sweet because of the pear. But the first few bites hint that more waves of flavor are about to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, there it is. Umami. It's the tiniest hint of the ocean, thanks to the fish sauce and fermented baby shrimp.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut you keep coming back to the actual napa cabbage. It's on the edge of being too salty. But then the natural sweetness of the vegetable balanced it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marinade for your kimchi is blended smooth with a food processor. It turns out you like this better than having chunks of onion, garlic, and pear.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while, you make this kimchi for friends. Some of them love it; others not so much. But it makes you happy that you can share this with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis isn't quite Grandma's kimchi.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut you wonder if Grandma also had to figure out a recipe for herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe lives in Korea these days. Since Grandpa's death, she doesn't really cook anymore. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou wonder: Did she even like to cook? Did she even like making kimchi?\r\n\r\n\r\nDid she only do it because that's what women were supposed to do? \r\n\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n\r\nYou pack the kimchi into two jars.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the kimchi ferments, you'll eventually make some kimchi stew with pork shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's one of your partner's favorite foods; she demands it every few weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou don't really know the recipe; you just kind of wing it, based on what you think will taste good.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou love making it for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning, you wake up to make coffee. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou smell the lingering scent of kimchi stew from the previous night.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see the white cutting boards stained with kimchi juice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are empty kimchi jars on the counter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA rogue speck of gochugaru sits on the countertop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou pour two cups of coffee and walk back to the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalfway to the bedroom, you wonder: Will I miss this one day?"}]}
